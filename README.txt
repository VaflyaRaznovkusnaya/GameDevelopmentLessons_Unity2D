This project is an old one. One month after I started to learn Unity to be excact.
(So I basically update github with my old work as well as new ones)
This project was made for my University class "Basics of game development".
I used some free assets (such as milk or butterfly in jar), and some royalty-free music.
All other assets was made by myself in paint. Hopefully, they aren't a sore to an eye.

You can play using WASD
and entaract or pick up items by E
By Q you can peek through doors or put down an item

You need to exit the house from a specific door (you start near that door). To open the door you need to enter a password.
There are three ways to obtain password: using a brute force, opening a special storage location (and messing with it) or completing butterfly puzzle (tough it would be in Russian language).

In folder "Game build" you can find game's last build that you can play
In folder "Raw code" you can find my scripts and assets that I used in Unity engine
Have fun!
